To learn how to use PyTorch,
begin with our Getting Started Tutorials.
The 60-minute blitz is the most common starting point,
and provides a broad view into how to use PyTorch from the basics all the way into constructing deep neural networks.

Some considerations:

If you would like to do the tutorials interactively via IPython / Jupyter,
each tutorial has a download link for a Jupyter Notebook and Python source code.
Additional high-quality examples are available,
including image classification, unsupervised learning,
reinforcement learning, machine translation, and many other applications, in PyTorch Examples.
You can find reference documentation for the PyTorch API and layers in PyTorch Docs or via inline help.
If you would like the tutorials section improved, please open a github issue here with your feedback.
Lastly,
some of the tutorials are marked as requiring the Preview release.
These are tutorials that use the new functionality from the PyTorch 1.0 Preview.
Please visit the Get Started section of the PyTorch website for instructions on how to install the latest Preview build before trying these tutorials.
